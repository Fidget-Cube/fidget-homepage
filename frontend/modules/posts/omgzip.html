</h2>
<p id="description">Just this past weekend, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pacifichackers/">Pacific Hacker's Association</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/hackmiami/">HackMiami</a> joined forces to compete in the <a href="https://quals.2023.nautilus.institute/index.html">DEFCON CTF Qualifiers</a>. The top 12 teams from this CTF go on to play the most competitive and challenging CTF in the world at DEFCON 31. Though, to be fair, our team wasn't of that caliber. We were able to solve 2 challenges (not counting the sanity checks) and finished in 92nd place, which is a great success by my standards! I was able to solve this one with the help of my friend Sam. It's a reverse engineering challenge, but with Python code instead of x86 assembly, which makes things much nicer.</p>
