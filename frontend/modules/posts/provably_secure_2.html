<p id="description">This server is basically a simulation of the IND-CCA2 game testing a custom cryptographic system. The game is described in detail here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability</a>.</p>
<p id="description">The server makes 128 passes, generating a random bit (0 or 1) each pass. Our goal is to call a &quot;Solve&quot; function, and correctly &quot;guess&quot; the bit 128 times, at which point a flag is printed. In addition, the server also provides &quot;Query Encryption&quot; and &quot;Query Decryption&quot; functions.</p>
